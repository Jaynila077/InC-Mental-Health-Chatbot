# InC Mental Health Chatbot
InC Mental Health Chatbot is a conversational AI-based chatbot that provides mental health support to people who are struggling with their mental health. It is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## How it works
The chatbot is designed to have a natural and friendly conversation with the user, allowing them to share their thoughts and feelings. It uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to generate appropriate responses based on the user's input. The chatbot also offers resources and support for mental health.
